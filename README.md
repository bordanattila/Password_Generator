# Password Generator

## Description

The use of secured passwords is very important nowadays. Creating a secured password is not an easy task. People tend to pick words and numbers that they can easily remember. I often struggle to come up with a password that is not containing names or birthdays. Almost every website requires a registration lately that results in the repeated use of passwords. 
This application allows the user to create passwords with a few clicks that contain a random selection of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. That way it eliminates the use of names and birthdays of family members. 
This project allowed me to practice functions, exception handling, and dialogs.
