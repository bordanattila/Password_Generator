# Password Generator

## Description

The use of secured passwords is very imprtant nowadays. Creating a secured password is not an easy task. People tend to pick words and numbers that they can easily remember. I myself often strugle to come up with a password that is not not containing names or bithdays. Almost every website requires a registrations lately that result in the repeated use of passwords. 
This application allows the user to creat passwords with a few clicks that contains random selection of uppercase and lowercase letter, numbers, and symbols. That way it eliminates the use of names and birthdays of familymembers. 
This project allowed me to practice functions, exception handling, and dialogs.
